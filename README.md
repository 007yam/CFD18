Code.Fun.Do 18

What follows is the idea that we will try to implement for the Code.Fun.Do 2018:

Current Scenario:

Natural Disasters are the leading cause of loss of human lives and properties at large scale all around the globe. This is such a problem which we don't even think to tackle (at least till now or a couple of years back), rather we just focus on the aftermath. 

What we are going to change:

But what if we change the way we look at the Natural Disasters. What if instead of disaster management and just worrying about the aftermath and restoration, we could focus on minimizing the damage caused. What if we could predict natural disasters beforehand.
Making this prediction our base, we are going to build (or at least try to build) a utility software that predicts natural calamities beforehand. Using this vital information, we can save numerous lives and prevent loss of property.

How we are going to make it happen:

Precisely speaking, for now we will be trying to predict the weather related disasters like cyclones, tornados, typhoons, cloudburst etc. only. 
For this, we will taking as input the weather details of a place over years from various platforms (weather update websites, official government weather data of the place), and whenever circumstances arise resembling some past natural calamities, we will be get notified. We will be knowing what kind of disaster it will be, and around what time it will be hitting/occuring, using Microsoft tolls extensively.
Having gotten this information, we can act accordingly. This will be our step to a safer society.

Hope we make it.
